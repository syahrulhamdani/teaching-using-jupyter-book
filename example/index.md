# Welcome

Welcome to Teaching using Jupyter Book session delivered at PyCon Indonesia 4-5 December 2021.


## Motivation

Most teachers/instructors may have used both slides and notebooks while worrying about switching back and forth between those two before pausing due to confusion.
This talk will introduce Jupyter Book to create beautiful publication-quality teaching materials using only notebooks or markdowns.
